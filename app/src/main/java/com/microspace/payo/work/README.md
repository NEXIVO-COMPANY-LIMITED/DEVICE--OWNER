# Work Package

## Purpose
Infrastructure for scheduling long-running or periodic tasks using Android's WorkManager API.

## Key Functionalities
- **Periodic Workers**: Definitions for scheduled heartbeat sends and data synchronization.
- **Constraint Management**: Logic for ensuring workers run only under specific conditions (e.g., network available).
